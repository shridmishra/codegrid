            Before the camera, there was only the patient hand. Pigment ground
            by candlelight, flesh rendered warm against a dark that swallows
            everything at the edges of the frame.

            This is a room of Spanish shadow: gods caught mid-argument, men
            caught mid-breath. Each canvas holds a single suspended moment,
            stretched thin across four centuries, still refusing to look away
            from us the way we refuse to look away from it.

            We collect the paintings that hold their breath. The wine that never
            spills from a tilted cup, the note that never finishes leaving the
            reed, the eye that has been watching the same doorway since 1628.
            Every frame in this room is a single second refusing to end, and we
            spend our days deciding which of those seconds deserves a wall.
